To produce new translated menus using the R script:

1) install R-base, which will pull in a number of other packages
2) add new column to MenuTransItems.csv and populate with translations; header should be the 2-letter language code in lower case
3) copy this folder to a working location
4) open a terminal in this folder and enter

Rscript fluxbox.R

5) the output will include all existing translations along with any new ones; this can be avoided by deleting all existing language columns except the first English one before adding in a new language. There will be an extra menu-mx_en that can be discarded.

6) paste the new menu back into this folder
